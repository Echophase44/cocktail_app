# Cocktail_app

- This is an updated and reimagined version of an previous app I built. The original (seen here: https://github.com/Echophase44/Drinks_Mixer) was created using the basics in JS.
- I wanted to re-create it in React with a better, mobile friendly layout, more features, and start implementing a backend.

## ToDo for MVP

- Too much to list, once I get more of the obvious things out of the way I'll start breaking down the other ideas.
