# Cocktail_app

- This is an updated and reimagined version of an previous app I built. The original (seen here: https://github.com/Echophase44/Drinks_Mixer) was created using the basics in JS.
- I wanted to re-create it in React with a better, mobile friendly layout, more features, and start implementing a backend.

## ToDo for MVP

- Add ability to save favorites: icon over image and local storage.
- Add a "glow" effect or some sort of identifier to the selected drink in the display.

### Extra Features

- Add language selection for ingredients.
